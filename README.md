# VACAnalysis
Analyzes Vicon Nexus biomotion data. 
Files which are uploaded to the VAC Analysis repository are expected to be "full functions" in the following sense:
1. Functions have fully fleshed out help commands such that typing ```help functionName``` in MATLAB provides a useful set of documentation detailing inputs, outputs, and ideally an example. 
2. Functions are well documented/commented throughout. 
3. Functions are (ideally though not always) well tested on a variety of mocap data and are general enough to be used for >1 projects. 

(*Note:* this is primarily a reminder for myself while being a good reminder that people will use this after you're gone and you have a duty to make it useable)
